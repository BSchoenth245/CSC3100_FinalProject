## Overview

This iteration combines two existing project bases into a single, cohesive system.  
The goal is to integrate functionality from both teams, resolve known issues, and deliver a polished, mobile-friendly final product.

## Project Integration Plan

### Authentication and User Role Management

- Implement the **login and registration system** from Brock and Mitchellâ€™s team.
- Remove the manual selection of **student** or **professor** during registration.
- User roles will now be determined automatically through the registration system.

### Dashboard and Core Functionality

- **Student Dashboard** from John and Emersonâ€™s team will be preserved and enhanced.
- **Surveys and Comments** functionality will be merged into the student dashboard:
  - Allow surveys to be filled out by group members.
  - Allow comments to be added and properly displayed within group tabs or cards.
  - Comments and surveys will either pop up in cards or have a dedicated tab for organization.

### Group Creation and Management

- Add functionality for an **Instructor / Course Owner** to act as a **Group Owner**.
- **Create Group Form** will include:
  - **Group Name** field (user input).
  - **Course Name** field (read-only, or pre-filled if needed).
  - **Generate Code** button (auto-generates a unique group code).
  - **Create Group** button (creates the group and associates it with the instructor).
- Students will **join groups** using the generated group code.
- Groups will **automatically populate** on the dashboard once created or joined.

  - Each card will represent a group.
  - Cards will include **arrows** or visual indicators pointing to related groups or actions.
