# Class Group and Review System

This project is a collaboration between Brock, Emerson, John, and Mitchell as part of our Web Development coursework.  
It is a full-stack web application designed to help **students form groups**, **submit surveys and feedback** about their group experience, and allow **professors to view and manage group feedback** easily.

Our system combines two original project ideas into one final product, integrating the best features of each while improving responsiveness, backend functionality, and user experience.

## Project Purpose

- **For Students**:  
  - Join a group using a unique code.
  - Submit surveys and comments about group experiences.
  - View group membership, surveys, and comments from a unified dashboard.

- **For Professors / Course Owners**:  
  - Create groups and generate group codes.
  - Manage student groups and view submitted feedback and surveys.
  - Oversee courses and monitor group dynamics easily.

## Branch Structure

We use a simple two-branch system for development:

- **main**:  
  - Contains the most stable and production-ready code.
  - Only fully tested and reviewed changes are merged here.

- **development**:  
  - Active development branch.
  - All new features and updates are merged into `development` before going into `main`.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: SQLite
- **Architecture**: RESTful API Implementation

## Final Project Goals

- Deliver a clean, functional, and responsive platform for students and instructors.
- Successfully merge and enhance the best features from both original team projects.
- Ensure a seamless login and registration process.
- Allow instructors to manage groups and view feedback effectively.
- Create an intuitive, user-friendly dashboard for students to submit surveys and comments.
- Optimize the platform for mobile and desktop responsiveness.
